React Application for Searching Github Users

The application will initially render 15 Github users starting from the id of 0.

Scrolling to bottom of the app will automatically fetch and render 15 more Github users.

When the app user enters an value into the search bar, the app will render results based on the Github users already fetched.

Deleting everything in the search bar will re-render the Github users fetched from the API.

Clicking on Github users will render their profile page with 20 repos and 20 followers.
